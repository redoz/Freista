// The entry point is real, readable code — no generated Main, nothing hidden. This is where the
// AppHost is described, where you say what must be healthy before scenarios run, where the suite's
// own services are registered, and where its traces go.

// Tracing. Raun emits one span per scenario and one per step from the "Raun" ActivitySource, and
// never exports; the suite decides where they go. Exporting only when an OTLP endpoint is configured
// keeps a plain `dotnet run` quiet. With the endpoint set (a standalone Aspire dashboard is one
// `docker run` away — see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-06-tracing-design.md), each scenario is one
// trace: the step span, the HttpClient span under it, and the API's own spans under that, because the
// step span is Activity.Current while the step runs and HttpClient forwards its traceparent.
